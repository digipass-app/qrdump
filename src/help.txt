\033[1mqrdump: a tool for long-time paper archiving of data within multiple qr-codes.\033[0m

\033[1mRecommended use:\033[0m
    - dumping a file to a A4 document, using base64 encoding, in safe mode
      (check at once that extraction is ok), dumping also parchive codes (to
      allow error correction is needed):

    $ qrdump --create-A4 \
             --base64 \
             --safe-mode \
             --parchive \
             --output PATH_TO_OUTPUT \
             --input PATH_TO_FILE \
             --metadata "user-define message"

    - extracting a file from an A4 document dumped with the previous command:

    $ qrdump --read-A4 \
             --base64 \
             --input PATH_TO_A4_PDF \
             --output PATH_FOR_EXTRACTED

    - Currently, only base64 enoding is supported. See:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60506222 . Native binary encoding
      will be released as soon as zbarimg has been updated on most distros to
      support this.
    - For now, it is the responsibility of the user to zip / tar / other
      folders before feeding to qrdump if a whole tree should be archived.

For more details, see the manual: $ qrdump --manual
