qrdump: a tool for long-time paper archiving of data within multiple qr-codes.

Recommended use:
    - dumping a file to a A4 document, using base64 encoding, in safe mode (check at once that extraction is ok), dumping also parchive (to allow error correction is needed):

    $ qrdump --create-A4 \
             --base64 \
             --safe-mode \
             --parchive \
             --output PATH_TO_OUTPUT \
             --input PATH_TO_FILE \
             --metadata "user-define message"

    - extracting a file from an A4 document dumped with the previous command:

    $ qrdump --read-A4 \
             --base64 \
             --input PATH_TO_A4_PDF \
             --output PATH_FOR_EXTRACTED

Release notes:
    - At the current time, only base64 enoding is supported. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60506222 . Native binary encoding will be released as soon as zbarimg has been updated on most distros to support this.
    - For now, it is the responsibility of the user to zip / tar / other folders before feeding to qrdump if a whole tree should be archived.

For more details, see the manual: $ qrdump --manual
